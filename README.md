# slido-bot
bot for voting on slido  

# usage
only for multiple choice and you can only vote for one question (so far)  
./slido-bot.sh -h -- prints help  
./slido_bot.sh -u "\<url\>" -v \<question number\> -V \<number of votes\>  
35-50 votes seems to be the optimal number, after that the script shits itself
